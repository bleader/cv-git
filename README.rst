Note
----

This cv-git contains *reStructuredText* format files with information from my
resume, but the information also have been added in chronological order playing
with dates in commits.

Even through *github* web-ui can be sufficient and show *rst* converted to
proper *html*, some things are more readable from a shell.

Using **git log --reverse -p** will allow you to read through it in the right
order, and see what happened at what time.

To see *Education* or *Professional Experience* all at once::

  grep -h . Education/*
  grep -h . Professional_EXperience/*

Disclaimer
----------

I did this just for the fun of it and don't plan on using it as a CV
replacement, so don't take it too seriously, some dates are not precise, and I
didn't meant them to be.
